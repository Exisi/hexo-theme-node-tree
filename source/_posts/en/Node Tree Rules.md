The sidebar article directory on the left side of the interface will default to indexing all articles and file structure under source_posts, and then generate the article tree node.

## Node sorting
All nodes in the sidebar are sorted by date, with the earliest published articles appearing at the top. Therefore, the directory nodes also follow this rule, with each directory's time depending on the latest time of its sub-nodes, and then sorted at the same level.

## Enable directory nodes
To link the ndoe of the directory, you need to create a folder directory and then place a Markdown file with the same name inside it. The Node Tree will detect the presence of the same-named file and index it.

```
_posts
└── foo/
    ├── bar.md
    └── foo.md
```

However, it is important to note that the article title toc generated by the enabled directory nodes is at the same level as the sub-nodes, but you can distinguish it by the diamond symbol `◇` before the article title toc.

## Generate article toc of content
When a node is activated, it automatically parses all the headings within the article and generates a nested list toc of content. The style of the list of toc can be referenced from text that includes a diamond symbol `◇`.
